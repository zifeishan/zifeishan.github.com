Git is a version control system. It is a professional research skill, and an amazing way to manage our projects. I write this article to share how I am learning git, and gradually master it, both in its concept and
hands-on usage.

You can see it as a course, and our goal is to **master git in 8 weekends**, i.e. use your spare time in each week to play with git. Of course, it you want a rush, you can compress this into one week, and hopefully you can also master it.

In this curriculum, we use two popular materials: one is the book *Pro
Git*, which introduces Git as a whole, to help you understand the concept, many useful operations, as well as some useful patterns in development; the other is *Git Immersion*, a
guided tour that walks you through the fundamentals of git, featuring with many good libs.

* Materials

  - Book: http://git-scm.com/book

        Tips: if you are in a ruch, you can read the version with your mother language. Otherwise you are recommended to read the English version.


  - Labs: http://gitimmersion.com/
