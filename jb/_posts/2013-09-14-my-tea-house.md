I have a tea house, here in my home near Stanford campus. Here I have all kinds of tea brought from China, from [my teacher](http://blog.sina.com.cn/jingqinghe) who researches and makes Chinese tea very professionally. 

I would like to introduce my tea in this blog, and welcome to my house to try them out! You will surely find a flavor you like!

(I am still collecting pictures of my tea, and will upload them gradually.)

Lapsang souchong / Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong (正山小种)
====
Type: Red tea  
Origin: Mountain Wuyi, Fujian Province, China

### Xiao Chi Gan (小赤甘)



- Sweet and smells nice.

- Story: Xiao Chi Gan means "Small Red Sweetess" in Chinese. Xiao Chi Gan
  along with Da Chi Gan were both called Chi Gan by the Wuyi tea farmers.
  The only difference between them is that the tea tender leaves unfold or
  not when they are picked. Tea made of tender leaves already unfolding is
  called Da Chi Gan. Otherwise called Xiao Chi Gan. Chi Gan (including Da
  Chi Gan and Xiao Chi Gan) is also often called as Bronze Jun Mei. By the
  name, you must be able to tell that among the members of Lapsang
  Souchong, Chi Gan (Bronze Jun Mei) is only second to Golden Jun Mei (Jin
  Jun Mei) and Silver Jun Mei (Yin Jun Mei).

### Hong Xiu Tian Xiang (红袖添香)



- Named by my teacher. Slightly smoky. Its frangrance and taste is very subtle.

- Named by my teacher. It has a very special, variable and inviting taste.
  The taste will even differ when the weather changes.

- Story: Chinese poet Du Fu had a poem "夜雨剪春韭", means cutting chives on a
  rainy Spring night. The character "韭" (Jiu / chive) also comes from the
  place where the tea is picked --- JiuCaiWo (韭菜窝), a small village in
  Wuyi.
