  <h1>My Research</h1>

<p>The explosion of data provides us computer scientists a unique
opportunity for understanding the dynamics of the world --- knowledge
that has the potential to impact society. I am intrigued by the union
of data mining and information networks to answer fundamental
questions: How do large networks evolve? How do we better understand
large-scale human interactions? How are networks made robust to
unexpected behavior?</p>

<p>I have explored some of these questions during my undergraduate
studies. I led an independent research project to automatically rank
players in a baseball network. In a series of studies, I investigated
real-world phenomena using large-scale data provided by Renren, a
massive Chinese social network. Specifically, I led a project devising
defenses against profile-cloning attacks. I further collaborated on a
separate study on Sybil-attack detection. Finally, I was involved in
assessing the impact of user-interaction transparency on their
behavior.</p>

<p>This semester, as an undergraduate research-exchange student at
Technion, I am taking advanced graduate courses, engaging in academic
life, and pursuing new research directions as part of a vibrant
collaboration.</p>

<h2>Ranking and analyzing baseball network</h2>

<p>One topic that especially interests me is ranking and analyzing
baseball networks. This was my course project for 
<a href="http://open.umich.edu/education/si/si508/fall2008">SI 508---Networks: Theory and Application</a>, 
given by Prof. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/">Qiaozhu Mei</a> from UMich, in
which I got an overall picture of network science including network
models, metrics, evolution, diffusion, resilience, etc. The project
originates from my idea to regard American Major League Baseball (MLB,
of which I am a big fan) games as a network, with players as nodes and
their win-lose conditions in games as links. I always enjoy to use
real-world data, and felt it exciting to find online MLB game records
and parse them into networks.</p> <!-- Many players can pitch as well as
hit, and two indicators as pitching and hitting ability rely on each
other: A pitcher wining over good batters is a good pitcher, and vise
versa. -->

<p>To rank the players in the network, we first tried PageRank, but it
failed to describe a special attribute of the network: a pitcher who
defeats good batters is a great pitcher, and a batter who wins skilled
pitchers is an awesome batter. Faced with this obstacle, I used the
intuition in HITS algorithm (with hubs and authorities) to modify
PageRank, and raised a new random walk algorithm to measure the two
abilities. Our next problem was to evaluate our algorithm, when there
are no definite criteria to judge baseball rankings. Therefore I
compared our results to a prestige ranking system named ESPN Ratings,
and the plots show that we achieve similar results with ESPN while
having a simpler model and a wider capability.</p> <!-- First, I plotted
figures to demonstrate that our algorithm achieves similar results with
ESPN, with a simpler model and a wider capability. --><!-- and plotted
figures with Matplotlib comparing their differences. --> <!-- Second, I
used the intuition that for a good ranking system, players with higher
ranks should have higher probability to win in games. With this
assumption, I visualized the win rate for pitchers toward batters at
different rank levels, both for our algorithm and ESPN Ratings, to
illustrate that our results are even better. --> 
<p>In the data-mining
phase, I studied the network over time, and found <!-- from the degree
distribution of the baseball network in different years, --> interesting 
patterns that recent players are getting closer in their skills than before, 
and good pitchers are better than ordinary pitchers at batting.</p>

<p>In short, I enjoy this research because it involves understanding
social networks, their evolution, and their application to human
activities. 
As a future project, I might try to investigate
heterogeneous baseball networks involving both players and teams as
different types of nodes, to revise the ranking algorithm,
explore their evolution,
and test the robustness of each team based on data of in-team 
supports, to see whether the team is too dependent on certain players. 
Further research might lead to brand new strategies in real games.</p>

<h2>Defending against cloning attacks in OSNs</h2>

<p>My other independent research is about defending against cloning
attacks in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Cloning attackers disguise
fake accounts as existing users by copying
their profiles, and send requests to the friends of the cloned victim.
This project is motivated by my long time interest in making OSNs more
robust, and by my coincidental encounter with a cloning attack while
using Renren (a Facebook-style OSN in China).  I conducted a
literature search and found that although earlier studies described
this attack pattern, it cannot be adopted for large-scale attacks, and
they did not provide a method for defending against it. So I first
improved the attack pattern by snowball sampling (adding cheated
people's friend) and iteration attack (cloning cheated people's
friend), to point out its potential threats. Secondly we tested
its feasibility on Renren. Then I came up with a simple but
powerful server-side defending system by IP sequence matching. I also
notice that the defending strategy is fragile to IP spoofing, so in the
future I'd like to study stronger metrics of account identity, like
clicking pattern matching and action time similarity.</p>

<h2>Detecting Sybil groups in OSNs</h2>

</div>

<div class="span9" markdown=1>

<p>My major research project advised by Professor Yafei Dai in her Lab
is to detect Sybil Attack groups in OSNs. Sybil Attackers manipulate
multiple accounts to increase the attacker's power. We aimed at
detecting Sybil attacks in the wild, in cooperation with Renren---the
"Facebook in China" with over 200 million users. I worked with Jing
Jiang, a graduate student in our lab. Our paper is published in ICDCSW
'12, and improved work submitted to TKDD. I like the project because of
the chance to discover knowledge of human behaviors in the real-world
large dataset, the focus on solving widespread security problems, and
the analysis on network dynamics and communities. In the project, I
have coded all the programs in all phases from scratch, implemented
efficient algorithms to handle the graph with millions of nodes, and
designed many measurements based on discussion with Jing.</p>

<p>One special experience to me is in the evaluation phase, where I raised
and revised an indicator. We wanted to verify that the detected Sybil
groups are controlled by attackers, which matches my interest in
uncovering human behaviors behind the action pattern. We assumed that
among users in a group, the more similar their "action times" are, the
more likely they are manipulated. In order to quantify the "similarity"
of time points inside a group, I raised a new method: I sorted all the
points on the timeline, calculated the differences between adjacent
points, and got the median of all those differences, which is M.
However, I found that M was not a good indicator since it is
correlated with the number of time points N, illustrated by the
M-N log-log scatter diagram of random user groups. I explained this
phenomenon by intuition: as the length of the timeline is limited, the
more points there are, the more closely they are distributed onto the
timeline, and the smaller M it has. So I used MN as the new
indicator, and the diagram shows that the value is unrelated with N.</p>

<p>In the measurement phase, I mined the network and discovered lots of
knowledge.  Therein I enjoy the study of "group
merging pattern", inspired by an interest on evolutions of real-world
Sybil groups. I spotted that sometimes two connected components merge
into one, and I wanted to compare the difference between Sybil groups
and normal users in merging pattern. By making tables counting the size
of two components when they merge, I found that in Sybil groups,
"one-to-many merging" is the major pattern, and "many-to-many merging"
is far rarer than in normal groups, which indicates that Sybil groups
lack variety in merging pattern, with a majority of joining a new
account into an existing component. The result improves my interest in
network dynamics. </p>

<h2>Assessing the Impact of User-interaction Transparency in Social Networks</h2>

<p>I was involved in another project at lab, to understand latent user
interactions, working with Jing Jiang advised by Professor Dai. In
OSNs, profile browsing, which is latent to third-parties, are actually
the most prevalent type of user interactions. Supported with the
dataset provided by Renren, we compared this latent network with
visible one of comments and retweets, based on the dataset provided by
Renren. My work involved measuring structural properties including
conductance, modularity and mixing time, for both visible and latent
graphs. I enjoyed this research, in the process of understanding
characteristics of different networks in the wild, and quantifying the
human interactions. As a future question, it will be very attractive
for me to compare the dynamics of latent and visible networks,
especially their information diffusion, to discover how the hot topics
and rumors spread among users.</p>

<h2>Research Exchange Program at Technion</h2>

<p>This semester, I join a research exchange program at Technion, advised
by Professor Daniel Freedman. At Technion I am taking advanced graduate
courses, including seminars in Reliable Distributed Computing by Prof.
Idit Keidar, and Program Analysis and Synthesis by Prof. Eran Yahav. I
am also engaging in academic activities at Technion, being exposed to
lectures and colloquiums on a wide range of topics in Computer Science,
given by international researchers. Most importantly, I am exploring
new research directions as part of a vibrant group. Our topics span
Programming Language, Systems, and Human Computer Interaction. We
design description languages to automate the creation of both front-end
and back-end systems, and discover human behavior
patterns in interacting with services. </p>

<h2>Future Research Topics</h2>

<p>Other than the future work of my projects mentioned above, I am
attracted to more questions on constructing networks out of mass data
and discovering knowledge from them. Specifically, firstly I want to
scrutinize the evolution, resilience and information diffusion for
different OSNs, to improve their robustness, explore their dynamics and
discover human behaviors. Therein I especially want to model how rumors
and hot topics spread across the network, with the support of mining
big data. How do the rumors spread in Facebook and Twitter
respectively? What is the impact of their distinct nature of social
links (undirected or directed), to their information diffusion? How to
better model this propagation? What is the implication of this model to
the design of instant rumor detecting systems? Besides, how do hot
topics diffuse differently from rumors do? How to model the diffusion
of hot topics? How do people increase their influence in networks, to
easier raise hot topics?</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to combine network science with other disciplines to
solve problems in different areas: product relationships in business,
transportation organization in society, evil detection in criminology,
and gene theory in biology. How to study the dependencies and
centralities in a network of products of a company, to improve their
marketing strategy? How to model a transportation network, in order to
balance traffic for roads of high betweenness, and optimize traffic
lights to increase network capacity according to specific cases of
cities? How can we find conspiracy in criminal network based on its
features like long average shortest path? Finally, How can we adapt
network science, especially resilience theory, to human gene networks,
and help humans against disease? <!-- As an example, why gene
duplication has preferential attachment behavior, and how can we
utilize it? Why do decease genes form hubs or structure holes, and how
we detect them? --></p>
