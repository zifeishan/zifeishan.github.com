I am excited to bridge the gap between research and industry. Over the past few years, I have been building language technologies into different products with the goal of improving human lives.

I was one of the founding engineers (#4) of [Lattice Data](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lattice-data), a Silicon Valley startup in the field of data intelligence. Our mission was to turn [Dark Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_data) into structured knowledge bases. The startup has been [acquired by Apple](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/13/apple-acquires-ai-company-lattice-data-a-specialist-in-unstructured-dark-data/). I've been working at Apple since then.

I obtained my Master's in Computer Science in [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/). At Stanford, I was a research assistant with Professor [Christopher Ré](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/) in [InfoLab](http://infolab.stanford.edu/). I was one of the major developers of [DeepDive](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/), a well-recognized scalable general probabilistic inference engine that was later commercialized into Lattice.

I got my Bachelor's in CS from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I was a visiting student at [Technion--Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/en) on a Research Exchange Program. I was a research intern at [Toshiba](http://www.toshiba.com/) in Tokyo, and [Tableau Software](http://www.tableau.com/).
