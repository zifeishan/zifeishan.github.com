<h3 id="baseball">Baseball</h3>

I have been playing slowpitch softball for over two years. I love this sport, and I am the founder and former captain of [EECS Baseball Team](http://page.renren.com/601017046) in Peking University. Here is a photo of our team.

### Amateur Photography

I used to have a camera, but it got stolen. From then on I only use cellphone to take photos (in my undergrad). I am quite unprofessional and only do it for fun. Here is my little [gallery in Instagram](http://instagram.com/zifeishan) and one on [500px](https://500px.com/ZifeiShan).

I love making and tasting Chinese tea! I have all kinds of tea in my tea house here in California, and [HERE]({{ref:2013/09/14/my-tea-house/}}) is an introduction about it.

Life at Technion
</h2>

During the last year of my undergrad, I joined a research exchange program at Technion in Israel, advised
by Professor Daniel Freedman.
I enjoyed the total immerse of English environment --- both research and courses. I also enjoyed the life in that beautiful and mysterious country.

We traveled to Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, Bahaii Gardens, Beach at Haifa, Tel-aviv and Akko. Below is a photo of our group in the Old City of Jerusalem.
