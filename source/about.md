Life at Technion
----

This semester, I join a research exchange program at Technion, advised
by Professor Daniel Freedman. Other than the advanced courses I am taking, 
academic activities I am engaged in and research projects I am working on,
I also enjoy the life here.

We have travelled to Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, Bahaii Gardens, Beach at Haifa and Tel-aviv. Below is a photo of our group in the Old City of Jerusalem.

### Baseball

I have been playing slowpitch softball for over two years. I love this sport, and I am the founder and former captain of [EECS Baseball Team](http://page.renren.com/601017046) in Peking University. Here is a photo of our team.

### Amateur Photography

I used to have a camera, but it got stolen. From then on I only use cellphone to take photos. I am quite unprofessional and only do it for fun. Here is my little [gallery in Instagram](http://instajelly.com/zifeishan).
