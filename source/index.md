I am Zifei Shan (单子非). I am interested in bringing dark data to light --- extracting
structured information from unstructured data.

I work at [Lattice Data](http://lattice.io/) as one of the first engineers.

I obtained my Master's in Computer Science in [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/).
In Stanford, I was a research assistant with Professor [Christopher Ré](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/)
in [InfoLab](http://infolab.stanford.edu/). I was one of major developers of
[DeepDive](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/), a well-recognized scalable general probabilistic
inference engine.

I got my Bachelor's degree in CS from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn).
I was also a visiting student at
[Technion---Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/en) on a Research Exchange Program.
I interened at [Toshiba](http://www.toshiba.com/) Research & Development Center in Tokyo, and [Tableau Software](http://www.tableau.com/).
