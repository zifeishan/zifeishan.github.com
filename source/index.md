I am Zifei SHAN (单子非), a senior undergraduate in [Computer Science](http://http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) department of [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn). I was also a visiting student at [Technion---Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/en), on a Research Exchange Program.

<!-- My research interest lies in data mining and social and information networks. During my undergraduate studies I conducted researches in Online Social Networks (OSNs) under the supervision of my professors, and led two independent researches to discover knowledge in various networks. Meantime, I am keeping myself up with professional research skills, to become a qualified researcher in the future.
 -->

I will attend [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/) as a full master student in Computer Science (MSCS), starting from Fall 2013. 

I plan to focus on research during my masters, and apply to CS PhD programs at top US universities after master graduation. I want to become a faculty member in universities to continue my research career.

Research
----

My research interests are data mining and large social networks, 
in particular network dynamics and robustness, and human behaviors in real-world settings.
The general goal of my research is discovering knowledge and enriching machines' intelligence, thus enhancing the connection between the real world and the binary one.

During my undergraduate studies I lead independent research projects on
*ranking and analyzing competitive sports networks*, and <!-- dynamics -->
*defending against cloning attacks in Onine Social Networks (OSNs)*; <!-- robustness -->
I am also engaged into research topics in
*detecting Sybil groups in OSNs* <!-- robustness, dynamics -->
and *measuring latent and visible user interaction graphs*, <!-- human behaviors -->
supervised by Professor Yafei Dai in my lab.
Meantime, I am keeping myself up with professional research skills, to become a qualified researcher in the future.

### Research Group

I am in [Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Lab](http://net.pku.edu.cn/p2p/doku.php) of Peking University, advised by professor [Yafei Dai](http://cn.linkedin.com/pub/yafei-dai/9/291/b1). I mainly work with Dr. Jing Jiang on Online Social Networks.

I am one of the co-leaders of "Universal UI" research group, advised by Prof. [Daniel A. Freedman](http://www.danielfreedman.org). My team members are: [Scott Cheng](http://www.scottcheng.com), [Haoyu Zhang](http://www.haoyuzhang.org), Chris (Xiuhan) Hu, and Chen Yu.

I am on the "Technion-Peking Research Exchange Program", together with seven other PKU students: Annie Liu, [Haoyu Zhang](http://www.haoyuzhang.org), Zhao Yang, [Yilun Zhang](http://www.yilunzhang.com), Michelle Ma, Jason Lv, and Winnie Liu.
