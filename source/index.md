I am Zifei SHAN (单子非), a first-year Master's student in [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/) Computer Science, starting from Fall 2013. 

I am doing research with Professor [Christopher Ré](cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/) in [Stanford InfoLab](http://infolab.stanford.edu/).
I am interested in data mining, specifically using structural knowledge to improve low-level computer tasks. I believe that views from interdisciplinary areas can burst into wonderful ideas that refresh the world.

I got my Bachelor's degree in CS from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn). I was also a visiting student at [Technion---Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/en), on a Research Exchange Program for half a year.

What's New
====

* After one quarter's independent study, I decide to continue doing exciting research in Professor [Chris Re](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/)'s group! Currently I am working on leveraging structural knowledge to improve ensembled OCR systems. -- Dec 7, 2013
* Updated pictures of my [tea house]({{ref:2013/09/14/my-tea-house/}}). -- Oct 1, 2013
* I have redesigned my website! -- Sep 30, 2013


Research 
====

Currently I am interested in knowledge base construction with joint inference. In our group we are discovering how to use structural knowledge to improve low-level computer tasks like domain-specific OCR. We are using our scalable inference engine [DeepDive](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/) to empower our work.

In undergrad I was working on mining and modeling social and information networks, including ranking baseball players in a competition network, and detecting Sybil attacks in a massive online social network.

<!-- Research
----

My research interests are data mining and large social networks, 
in particular network dynamics and robustness, and human behaviors in real-world settings.
The general goal of my research is discovering knowledge and enriching machines' intelligence, thus enhancing the connection between the real world and the binary one.
 -->

<!-- During my undergraduate studies I lead independent research projects on
*ranking and analyzing competitive sports networks*, and 
*defending against cloning attacks in Onine Social Networks (OSNs)*; 
I am also engaged into research topics in
*detecting Sybil groups in OSNs* 
and *measuring latent and visible user interaction graphs*, 
supervised by Professor Yafei Dai in my lab.
Meantime, I am keeping myself up with professional research skills, to become a qualified researcher in the future.

<!-- ### Research Group

I was in [Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Lab](http://net.pku.edu.cn/p2p/doku.php) of Peking University, advised by professor [Yafei Dai](http://cn.linkedin.com/pub/yafei-dai/9/291/b1). I mainly work with Dr. Jing Jiang on Online Social Networks.

I am one of the co-leaders of "Universal UI" research group, advised by Prof. [Daniel A. Freedman](http://www.danielfreedman.org). My team members are: [Scott Cheng](http://www.scottcheng.com), [Haoyu Zhang](http://www.haoyuzhang.org), Chris (Xiuhan) Hu, and Chen Yu.

I was on the "Technion-Peking Research Exchange Program", together with seven other PKU students: Annie Liu, [Haoyu Zhang](http://www.haoyuzhang.org), Zhao Yang, [Yilun Zhang](http://www.yilunzhang.com), Michelle Ma, Jason Lv, and Winnie Liu.
