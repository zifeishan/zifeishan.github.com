Research Interests
====

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have been trying to find the ties between computers and real world, and I found two disciplines that interest me: one is Data Mining in <!-- social and information --> various networks, and the other is Human Computer Interaction. 

I get my hands wet in these areas, while keeping myself up with professional research skills, to become a qualified researcher in the future.

Here is my [DBLP](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/s/Shan:Zifei.html) link.

Baseball

I have been playing slowpitch softball for over two years. I love this sport, and I am the founder and former captain of [EECS Baseball Team](http://page.renren.com/601017046) in Peking University. Here is a photo of our team.

Amateur Photography

I used to have a camera, but it got lost. From then on I only use cellphone to take photos. I am quite unprofessional and only do it for fun. Here is my little [gallery in Instagram](http://instajelly.com/zifeishan).
