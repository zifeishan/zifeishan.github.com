I am Zifei SHAN (单子非), a senior undergraduate in [Computer Science](http://http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) department of [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn). Currently I am a visiting student at [Technion---Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/en), on a Research Exchange Program.

My research interest spans data mining in social and information networks, and Human Computer Interaction. During my undergraduate studies I conducted researches in Online Social Networks (OSNs) under the supervision of my professors, and led two independent researches to discover knowledge in various networks. Meantime, I am keeping myself up with professional research skills, to become a qualified researcher in the future.

I am applying for PhD programs in Computer Science at excellent US universities, and I plan to become a faculty in universities to continue my research career.
